![Introducing Slash](assets/docusaurus/slash-introducing.png)

We are very happy to introduce [Docusaurus](https://github.com/facebook/Docusaurus) to help you manage one or many open source websites.

We created [Docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io) for the following reasons:

1. To put the focus on writing good documentation instead of worrying about the infrastructure of a website.
1. To provide features that many of our open source websites need like blog support, search and versioning.
1. To make it easy to push updates, new features, and bug fixes to everyone all at once.
1. And, finally, to provide a consistent look and feel across all of our open source projects.

## Acknowledgements

Docusaurus wouldn't exist without the work of the rest of the core Docusaurus team: [Eric Nakagawa](http://twitter.com/ericnakagawa), [Hector Ramos](https://twitter.com/hectorramos), [Eric Vicenti](https://twitter.com/EricVicenti) and [Frank Li](https://github.com/deltice) â€” a former intern at Facebook who implemented the core technology and features.

Special thanks also goes out to our earliest [adopters](https://docusaurus.io/en/users.html) of Docusaurus:

- [BuckleScript](https://bucklescript.github.io/)
- [FastText](https://fasttext.cc)
- [Jest](https://facebook.github.io/jest/)
- [Make It Open](http://makeitopen.com)
- [Prettier](https://prettier.io/)
- [Reason-react](https://reasonml.github.io/reason-react/)
- [React Native](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/)
- [Relay](https://facebook.github.io/relay/)

Without their dedication to creating or migrating their websites over to the platform, we would have not have been in the position where we are today.
